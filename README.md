#### zookeeper
```nohup bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties > /log/zookeeper.log &```
It listens on port 2181.

To make sure that it is working, connect to it via Telnet:
```telnet localhost 2181```

At the Telnet prompt, type in ```ruok``` and press ENTER.

If everything's fine, ZooKeeper will say ```imok``` and end the Telnet session.
